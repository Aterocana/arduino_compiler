# arduino_compiler
A command line Arduino compiler written in C++.

It's just a very basic compiler written on top of <code>arduino</code> command line compiler. It lets you specify some default options so that you can compile your .ino files faster.

Please, help me to improve it :)

<h1>Installation</h1>
You must have Arduino IDE installed (actually just the command line tool which is shipped with Arduino IDE).
Compile it with a c++ compiler and put it in your path in order to have it working in your whole OS.
